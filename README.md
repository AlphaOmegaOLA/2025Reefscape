This is the 2025 season REEFSCAPE robot code repository of FIRST Robotics (FRC) team 7094 Alpha Omega at Our Lady Academy School in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi. We are building a modified version of the [Rusthounds Ri3D bot](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/rusthounds-ri3d-2025/477760/71) We are using our mentor team's [Pracitical Neo Swerve code](https://github.com/TeamFusion364/PracticalNeoSwerve) for our SDS Mk4i drive system.
